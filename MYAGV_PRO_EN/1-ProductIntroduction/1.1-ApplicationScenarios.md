## 1.1 Application scenario
As the core carrier of the intelligent mobile platform, myAGV Pro provides end-to-end solutions for intelligent manufacturing, logistics, service robots and other fields by flexibly carrying robotic arms of different specifications (from lightweight collaborative arms to heavy-duty industrial arms), combining perception systems and AI algorithms, covering the two major directions of embodied intelligent training and fixed-scene automated operations.

- Logistics sorting training ground：The myCobot320+ suction pump robotic arm builds an express sorting environment and supports reinforcement learning data collection and strategy verification of grabbing-loading actions

- Home service simulation environment：The myArm M750 robotic arm simulates dirty laundry storage tasks and provides a multi-modal training dataset for haptic feedback and visual recognition

- Smart office interaction experiment：myCobot Pro630 robotic arm + force-controlled gripper + vision system reproduces the CMU door opening task, and supports the optimization of imitation learning algorithms based on physical interaction
