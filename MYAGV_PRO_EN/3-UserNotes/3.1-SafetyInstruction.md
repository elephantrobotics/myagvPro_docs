##  3.1 Safety Tips
### 1. Precautions for the use of emergency stop switch

**Equipment location**: Located behind the myAGV, a red circular emergency stop button.

**Function positioning**: The emergency stop switch is the core safety device for AGV emergency braking. It is used to immediately cut off power and force the equipment to stop running when an abnormality occurs or personnel/equipment is in direct danger.

**Trigger conditions**:
- Abnormalities such as sudden noise, smoke, and loss of control during AGV operation;
- Detection of personnel or obstacles entering the dangerous area and the obstacle avoidance system does not respond;
- The equipment collides with other objects and does not stop automatically;
- Emergency tasks require interruption of AGV action (such as personnel injury, fire, etc.).

    (Non-emergency situations (such as debugging and path adjustment) are prohibited from being triggered at will to avoid affecting production or triggering the interlocking shutdown of the production line)

**Operation specification**: After triggering, the safety of the surrounding environment of the AGV must be checked immediately (personnel evacuation, obstacle removal); when resetting, the emergency stop button must be rotated clockwise (or unlocked as required by the manual), and the equipment must be restarted through the control panel/remote control;
After resetting, low-speed operation must be tested (such as short-distance movement in manual mode), and automatic tasks must be resumed after confirming that there are no abnormalities.

**Daily maintenance**: It is forbidden to shield the emergency stop function by physical blocking, disconnection or software modification; perform emergency stop function test at least once a month (simulate triggering and verify shutdown response).

### 2. Precautions for using anti-collision strips

**Equipment location**: There is an anti-collision strip at the bottom edge of the front and rear of the myAGV.

**Function positioning**: The anti-collision strip is a first-level physical protection device of the AGV, which is used to reduce the impact force when contacting obstacles to avoid equipment or personnel injuries.

**Daily inspection**: Regularly check whether the anti-collision strip is aging, cracking or falling off (especially the parts that frequently contact the ground), and replace it in time; keep the surface of the anti-collision strip clean to avoid oil and dust accumulation affecting the sensitivity of the sensor (mechanical type needs to clean the surface, and electronic type needs to be moisture-proof and dust-proof).

**Post-trigger processing**: After the anti-collision bar is triggered, the AGV will stop urgently and need to be checked immediately:
- Whether the collision part is damaged (such as body deformation, sensor failure);
- The source of obstacles (people entering by mistake, shelf offset, foreign objects on the ground), eliminate safety hazards;
- If the anti-collision bar falls off or is damaged, the AGV needs to be stopped and repaired.
- After resetting, the anti-collision bar function needs to be tested in low-speed mode to see if it is normal (such as manually approaching the obstacle to verify the response).

- **Function boundary**: The anti-collision bar can only reduce the impact of low-speed collisions and cannot replace the safety distance management. It is necessary to ensure that there are no people frequently passing through the AGV operation path, and set up physical isolation fences (such as safety fences, light curtains). If the anti-collision bar is frequently triggered, it is necessary to check whether the active obstacle avoidance sensor fails first.

> Tips: The emergency stop switch and anti-collision bar are the last line of defense for the safe operation of the AGV. Users must strictly abide by the operating specifications, perform regular maintenance and inspections, and are strictly prohibited from unauthorized modification or shielding of functions;
