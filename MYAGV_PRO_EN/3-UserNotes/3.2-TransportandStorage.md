## 3.2 Product Maintenance
### 1. Environmental Requirements
- Environmental Type: The device is only suitable for indoor environments. It is prohibited to operate outdoors, in rain, snow, humidity or dusty environments.
- Dust and Waterproof: Avoid wading (including ground water) and avoid large particles of dust entering the fuselage (such as the gap between the Mecanum wheels and the sensor interface), otherwise it may cause a short circuit or mechanical failure.
- Ground Conditions: It is prohibited to drive on mud, gravel or uneven roads to avoid wearing the Mecanum wheels or causing sensor misjudgment.

### 2. Daily Maintenance of the Body
1. Cleaning and Maintenance:

- Clean the body surface (especially the bottom and anti-collision strip) after daily use, and wipe dust and oil with a soft cloth;
- Regularly check whether there are foreign objects attached to the surface of the Mecanum wheels (such as paper scraps, plastic fragments), and clean them in time to avoid slipping or power loss;
- The sensor (lidar, camera, etc.) needs to be cleaned with a dry cloth. Alcohol and corrosive solvents are prohibited.

2. Mechanical parts inspection:
- Check the wear of the McDonnell Douglas wheel weekly (such as whether the tread is cracked or the axle is loose). If any abnormality is found, it needs to be replaced in time;
- Check whether the body structure parts (such as brackets and connectors) are loose, and the fastening bolts need to be tightened according to the standard torque.

3. Electrical system maintenance:
- Regularly check whether the battery interface and power cord are oxidized or loose. Poor contact may cause power outage. It is prohibited to disassemble electrical components privately. Maintenance must be performed by professional technicians.

### 3. Long-term storage requirements
- If the equipment needs to be out of use for a long time (more than 7 days), the power supply must be disconnected and the AGV must be parked in a dry and ventilated place;
- The McDonnell Douglas wheel needs to be suspended or padded to avoid long-term pressure deformation;
- The battery needs to be kept at 50%-70% power and charged regularly (recommended once a month) to prevent over-discharge damage.
